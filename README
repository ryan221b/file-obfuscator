File Obfuscator v0.1

* ABOUT *
---------
File Obfuscator is a simple programme that provides a thin layer of protection
against unwanted users peeking at your files by scrambling their contents
acoording to a passsword.


* INSTALLATION *
----------------
Install by the standard GNU Build chain.

Open a terminal in the extracted FileObfuscator-0.1 folder. Now type:
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	
If you don't have root priviliges, pass the '--prefix=$HOME' (without quotes)
to the 'configure' script, and run 'make install' without 'sudo':
	./configure --prefix=$HOME
	make
	make install
	
Read the INSTALL file for more details.

* UNINSTALLATION *
------------------
Open a terminal in the FileObfuscator-0.1 folder and run:
	make uninstall
	
This should remove the programme from your system.


* USAGE *
---------
Use is quite simple, as the application runs with a Graphical User Interface
or GUI, for short.

You will be presented with 2 text boxes:
	- File: Path to the file to encrypt/decrypt
	- Key: A password to encrypt/decrypt the file
	
Click the Scramble button to create an encrypted file (it will only be active
when both the File and Key entrys have text) with the same name and a '.obf'
extension. For example:

	Joe Hacker has a 'secret' file on his desktop he wishes to protect from
	prying eyes, so he runs 'fileobfuscator' and fills in the form,
	| File: /home/jhacker/Desktop/secret |   and   | Key: mypass |
	Now he clicks on Scramble and a 'secret.obf' file appears on his desktop.
	When he wants to retrieve his original file he repeats the process,
	| File: /home/jhacker/Desktop/secret.obf |   and   | Key: mypass |
	This creates a new file 'secret.obf.obf' just like 'secret'.

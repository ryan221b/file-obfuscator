List of tasks:

 * Add file browsing button / combo box action
 * Move XOR scramble to separate function
 * Modify error handling:
 	- In-depth error messages printed to stderr inside functions where they are
 	  recieved
 	  ' Example: readData() prints file open errors to stderr and throws
 	    exceptions with lesss information (possibly only return bool?)
 	- Exceptions need only notify enclosing functions for GUI error reporting
 	  via InfoBar
 	  ' Example: readData() may throw exceptions with a message to be added to
 	    the GUI's InfoBar. (If errors are predictable, return bool from
 	    function and hard-code messages?)
 * Add Command Line Interface
 * Add overwrite original file option (CLI and GUI)
 * Conform to GNU standards by adding --help and --version command line options
 * Internationalization / translation
 * Recognise .obf extensioned file and remove it after un-scrambling
 * Look into fixing the ChangeLog
